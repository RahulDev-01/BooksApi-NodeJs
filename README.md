# BooksApi‑NodeJs

A simple RESTful API for managing books, built with Node.js.

---


## Features

* CRUD operations for books (create, read, update, delete)
* Data validation
* Error handling
* Database support (via Drizzle or your choice)
* Possibly authentication / authorization (if implemented)

---

## Tech Stack

* **Node.js**
* **Express.js** (for routing and HTTP server)
* **Drizzle** (as ORM / database layer)
* Any database supported by Drizzle (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
* Middleware for error handling, validation, etc.

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* Node.js (v14+ or whatever version used)
* npm or yarn
* Database running (e.g. PostgreSQL/MySQL)
* Environment variables / config set up

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RahulDev-01/BooksApi-NodeJs.git
   cd BooksApi-NodeJs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file (or however it's configured) and configure things like:

   ```text
   DB_HOST=...
   DB_PORT=...
   DB_USER=...
   DB_PASSWORD=...
   DB_NAME=...
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Run database migrations / setup**

   If using Drizzle, run the migration scripts.
   If a `docker-compose.yml` is provided, you may also use that to spin up database + related services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

5. **Start the server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or if using nodemon for development:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Test endpoints**

   Use Postman / Insomnia / cURL to test. Once running, API might be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` or the configured port.

## Configuration

| Variable      | Description                  | Example           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `PORT`        | Port on which server listens | `3000`            |
| `DB_HOST`     | Database host                | `localhost`       |
| `DB_PORT`     | Database port                | `5432` (Postgres) |
| `DB_USER`     | DB username                  | `user`            |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | DB password                  | `password`        |
| `DB_NAME`     | Name of database             | `booksdb`         |

## API Endpoints

Here are some typical endpoints. Adjust based on your actual code:

| Method   | Endpoint     | Description             |
| -------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `GET`    | `/books`     | Get list of all books   |
| `GET`    | `/books/:id` | Get a single book by ID |
| `POST`   | `/books`     | Create a new book       |
| `PUT`    | `/books/:id` | Update a book by ID     |
| `DELETE` | `/books/:id` | Delete a book by ID     |

**Request / Response Examples**

* **Create book**

  Request:

  ```json
  POST /books
  {
    "title": "Book Title",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "publishedYear": 2025,
    "genre": "Fiction"
  }
  ```

  Response:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Book Title",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "publishedYear": 2025,
    "genre": "Fiction",
    "createdAt": "2025‑09‑12T12:34:56.789Z"
  }
  ```

If you like, I can generate a README tailored exactly by reading the code (endpoint names, validation, database details) from the repo. Do you want me to do that?
